        <h6>Hey there! I'm Nima D. Sherpa. <br>
          Nepal born, New York based.<br> <br>

        I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in  <br>
        Computer Science and Information Security with a Mathematics Minor <br>
        at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. <br><br>

        I'm really passionate about all things tech-related. <br>
        I love the challenge of building something from scratch and making it work just the way I want it to. <br>
      
        Specifically, I'm really interested in artificial intelligence and how it can be used to solve complex problems.<br> <br>

        Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing football (soccer) and spending time with my buddies.<br>
        I'm a big fan of video games. But at the end of the day, I always come back to technology - it's my passion, <br>
        and I can't imagine pursuing any other field.</h6>
