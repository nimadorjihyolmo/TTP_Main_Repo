    <div class="border">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ingredients:</b></li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Butter or oil for greasing the pan (optional)</li>
                <li>Optional toppings: maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Instructions:</b></li>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, whish together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt ultil well combined.</li>
                <li>Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the milk, egg, and melted butter or oil. Whisk the wet ingredients together in the well, gradually incorporating the dry ingredients until you have a smooth batter. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are fine.</li>
                <li>Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes. This allows the baking powder to activate and helps create fluffy pancakes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. If desired, lightly grease the surface with butter or oil.</li>
                <li>Once the skillet is hot, ladle about 1/4 cup of batter onto the surface for each pancake. Use the back of the ladle or a spoon to spread the batter into a round shape, if needed.</li>
                <li>Cook the pancakes for 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles start to form on the surface. Flip the pancakes using a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm while you cook the remaining batter. You can also keep them warm in a preheated oven set to a low temperature.</li>
                <li>Serve the pancakes with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
